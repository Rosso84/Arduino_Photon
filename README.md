# Embedded_systems_exam (grade: A)
This is a birdhouse-project that alerts your phone through wifi when there is a bird inside the birdhouse using photon. 
The birdhouse was already finished made and i bought at a store named panduro. The reason why i bought it is because it allows you to 
simply place it on to a window with suction cups and the peak through the window inside it with a mirror wall which comes with it. 

## About 
For the moment the guide-through documentation is only in norwegian and is written inside dokumentasjon.pdf .
The sourcecode was required to write in an online IDE (https://login.particle.io/login?redirect=https://build.particle.io/build) 
and is linked to inside the documentation in norwegian and so is a videopresentation on youtube (at the bottom inside dokumantasjon.pdf).
