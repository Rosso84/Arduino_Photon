# Embedded_systems_exam 
This is a birdhouse-project that alerts your phone through wifi when there is a bird inside the birdhouse using photon. 
The birdhouse was already finished made which I bought at a store. The reason why I bought it is because it allows you to 
simply place it on to a window with suction cups and you peak through the window inside it with a mirror wall (which comes with it). 
Like fishing you dont want to sit and stear at the thing that floats (dont know what you call it in english) all day. 
So I created a system that alerts you through wifi to a mobile. I allso added lightbulbs on the roof of the birdhouse which flashes differently based on the situation. 

## About documentation
For the moment the guide-through documentation is only in norwegian and is written inside dokumentasjon.pdf .
The sourcecode was required to write in an online IDE (https://login.particle.io/login?redirect=https://build.particle.io/build) 
and is linked to inside the documentation in norwegian and so is a videopresentation on youtube (at the bottom inside dokumantasjon.pdf) in page 4.
